This project demonstrates the creation of a simple e-commerce database using SQL. 
It includes designing and creating tables, defining relationships using primary and foreign keys, and understanding the structure through an ER diagram.
I designed 4 core tables required for a basic e-commerce system: Customers, Products, Orders and Ordered_Items Table.

Then designed the schema with proper one-to-many relationships to reflect real-world data flow in an e-commerce system:
One customer can place many orders.
One order can have multiple items.
One product can appear in multiple ordered items.

The Flow is 

Customers ──< Orders ──< Ordered_Items >── Products

As a conclusion I learned the basics of designing a normalized e-commerce database.
